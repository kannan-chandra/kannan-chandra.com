title: "Day 3: CSS animations"
---

On Day 3, I play with CSS animations.

{% include 	image.html url="/images/30-in-30-1.png" description="" %}

Today I ran through some basic CSS animation concepts. I've seen [Mary Lou](https://twitter.com/crnacura)'s countless animation demos on [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops), and they are AMAZING. Seriously, [check](http://tympanus.net/Development/ArrowNavigationStyles/) [them](http://tympanus.net/Development/IconHoverEffects/) [out](http://tympanus.net/Tutorials/AnimatedBorderMenus).

I learnt about:

- CSS transitions
- Using the :hover pseudo selector effectively
- Named keyframe animations
- 3D transforms

I want to sit down and construct a few full animation demos like one of the Codrops pages one day. I want to explore 3D transforms more, and also see if I can turn some of these into reusable components one can just drop into a page.

I've added one of the hover effects to the links on this site as well.


Have a look at the [source code on Github](https://github.com/kannan-chandra/30-in-30/tree/master/day-3-css-animations).
