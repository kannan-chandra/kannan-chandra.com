title: "Day 4: Less"

On Day 4, I try out Less.

Less is a CSS preprocessor that lets you structure your CSS in a sane way that mirrors your HTML. It also gives you a lot of useful constructs like variables and mixins that lets you write much more modular stylesheets. Less and Sass (also SCSS) are the two big CSS preprocessors, and today I give the first a shot.

I wanted to run through the main differences between Less and SCSS, so I'd have a point of comparison when I do SCSS later. I ran the Less compiler from the command line a few times, and started using SimpLESS to autocompile after that.

Things I covered :

- Variables
- Mixings
- Color modifier methods
- Media queries
- Overriding Bootstrap's default variables using Less
