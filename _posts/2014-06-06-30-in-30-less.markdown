title: "Day 4: Less"
---

On Day 4, I try out Less.

{% include 	image.html url="/images/30-in-30-1.png" description="" %}

I wanted to run through the main differences between Less and SCSS, so I'd have a point of comparison when I do SCSS later. I ran the Less compiler from the command line a few times, and started using SimpLESS to autocompile after that.

Things I covered :

- Variables
- Mixings
- Color modifier methods
- Media queries
- Overriding Bootstrap's default variables using Less
