title: "Day 1: jQuery"
---

On Day 1 of the [30 Day Challenge](/posts/30-in-30), I tackle jQuery, *the* Javascript library.

{% include 	image.html url="/images/30-in-30-1.png" description="" %}

I've put together a small app (I'm using the term very loosely here) that calculates total savings based on annual savings and interest rate. Not a very useful app, but I've used it to explore some basic jQuery concepts:

- DOM element selection
- DOM manipulation (adding, removing, adding classes)
- Attaching events (click, onchange)
- Load JSON data asynchronously
- Animation

Have a look at the [source code on Github](https://github.com/kannan-chandra/30-in-30/tree/master/day-1-jquery).
